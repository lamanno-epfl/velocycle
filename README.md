# velocycle

Manifold-constrained variational inference for RNA velocity of the cell cycle. This is the repository for the VeloCycle framework. Installation instructions and tutorials can be found below.

## Getting started

Please refer to the installation instructions below as well as the [tutorials]() contained in this repo.

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.10 or newer installed.

For convenience, we provide an xml file with this repo with which you can install a conda environment pre-prepared to run VeloCycle.

1. Install the latest release on PyPI:

```bash
pip install velocycle
```

2. Install the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/lamanno-epfl/velocycle.git@main
```

## Release notes

This is the initial release of VeloCycle corresponding to [Lederer et al. 2023](). These software are still under continuous development.

## Contact

For questions and help requests, you can reach out to [Alex Lederer](mailto:alex.lederer@epfl.ch) and [Gioele La Manno](mailto:gioele.lamanno@epfl.ch). We are happy to hear your feedback and comments!
